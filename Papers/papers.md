### 1. Deep Neural Network Approach to Forward-Inverse Problems

<https://www.aimsciences.org/article/doi/10.3934/nhm.2020011>

- PINN is the method to solve the pde using neural network.
- (studied basic settings before)
- How to use this in Inverse problem? ... Estimating operator's parameter together with loss convergence.
- typo) TP equation IC, coefficients. 10/4, not 0.25
- Figure says (alpha, beta, delta, gamma) = (1, 0.4, 0.1, 0.4) (convergence points)
but the below statement is told as (1, 0.4, 0.4, 0.1)
I followed figure's guide, (1, 0.4, 0.1, 0.4)
